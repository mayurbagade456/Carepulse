ðŸŒŸ Excited to Share! ðŸŒŸ

I'm thrilled to announce that Iâ€™ve developed a Healthcare Patient Management Application and successfully hosted it on Vercel! ðŸš€

This app streamlines patient-doctor interactions by enabling patients to register, book, and manage appointments while offering admins tools to schedule, confirm, or cancel appointments.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:

Next.js for seamless performance
TypeScript for type-safe development
Appwrite for backend services
TailwindCSS for sleek, responsive UI
Twilio for SMS notifications
Sentry for monitoring performance
ðŸ”‘ Features Include:
âœ… Patient registration and appointment booking
âœ… Admin management of appointments
âœ… Real-time SMS appointment confirmations
âœ… File uploads via Appwrite Storage
âœ… Full responsiveness across all devices

You can check out the live app here: https://carepulse-omega-two.vercel.app/

A huge thanks to the amazing open-source tools and community for making this possible. Feedback is always welcome, and Iâ€™m happy to discuss the journey behind building this app!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
